	<h3>Installation of GIT</h3>
	Basics
		1. install git from a website 
		2. use terminal for mac and create a folder 
		3. go to newly Created Directory and do GIT Init 
		4. echo 'hello world ' readme.txt
		5. this is default editor . 
			to add text press "i" 
			press escape "esc" to come out of insert mode 
			write ":wq" then press enter 
		6. to add the file to master use 'git add readme.txt'
		Now check the git log you will see what is added to the master 

		7. at this stage we have readme.txt file staged 
		  if i want to edit the content in the file use "vim readme.txt"
		8. again press "i" to insert the content and use "esc" followed by ":wq"
		9. git add -u to add changes to staged stage.
		10. next type git log to get information about all commits 
		11. type git diff commit1..commit2 will show you the difference in the commited information - shorthand "git diff HEAD~1" will show latest changes in commit made .
		12. touch file1.txt. file2.txt
		13. git add -u will move the changes to staged state 
		14. git add -A will add all untracked files to staged state 
		15. rm file2.txt will delete the file from local machine

		16. git add -u - will stage the deletion for the next commit 

		17. mv file1.txt new_file_name.txt  will rename file1.txt to new_file_name.txt  - terminal will not show it as renamed but it will show that it has deleted file1.txt and created untracked new_file_name.txt 

		18. git add -A will stage  new_file_name.txt and understands that file1.txt is renamed to new_file_name.txt  . Be carefull with this statement git add -A will stage all the files 


		19. to unstage the files git reset HEAD sudeep sameera arbaz
			commit the changes using 
			git commit -m "message for commiting"	
			git reset -- hard HEAD~1 - Will remove last commit you have made
			git reset -- hard HEAD~2 - will remove last two commits you have made 

		/********************/

		1. touch temp1.txt temp2.txt 
		2. you can clean the files by using 
			git clean -n -> will ask for removing the temp1.txt temp2.txt 
			git clean -f -> will remove the temp1.txt temp2.txt
		3. git remote -v -> will check if they have a local repository and is local repository linked with external repositories or not 
			if we didnot add any repositories then it will not return any value 
		4. git remote add origin https://github.com/kpavankumaar/gitfundamentals.git
		this can be used to examine the changes made to project 
		5. need to complete merging

		/*********** git push*********/
		<!-- /*********** git push*********/ -->
		Error Message 

		pavans-MacBook-Pro:digital pavankumarkondaparthy$ git push origin master 
		git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
		fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

		Solution: - 
		SSH Key generation

		1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "k.pavanlumaar@gmail.com" 
		 this will generate key 
		
		list of questions asked by terminal 

		a.Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
		b.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
		c.Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
		for above pointers a,b,c you can leave it empty and press enter 

		generating PID - process id . This id represents single thread and at any given moment will allow one connection

		2. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 
		Agent pid 59566

		3.ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
		to add ssh key 

		pbcopy is in image format to convert this into pbcopy to text format use the following step 

		pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

		--- to copy public key

		goto www.github.com --> login --> goto settings --> SSH and GPG keys --> copy the SSH Key --> ADD SSH Key

		push your changes with  git push -u origin master

		********************** visualizing branches ********************
		following statement will help you visualize a branch 

		git log --graph --oneline 

		next statement will help you visualize all branches 
		git log --graph --oneline --all

		giving alias name to graph online all 
		git config --global alias.lga "log --graph --oneline --all --decorate"

		-> cat ~/.gitconfig
		will display the value of lga = log --graph --oneline --all --decorate
		********************** creating tags **********************
		creating a tag 
		git tag v1.0 

		viewing a tag 
		git tag 

		tag v1.0 will always point the same commit number;

		so far unsigned tags 

		we can add message with a tag 
		git tag -a v1.0_with_message

		if you type "git tag " it will show two tags 

		create a tag with signature 

		git tag -s v1.0_signed
		<!-- bugs related to signed tags 
			pavans-MacBook-Pro:digital pavankumarkondaparthy$ git tag -s v1.0_signed 
			fatal: cannot run gpg: No such file or directory
			error: gpg failed to sign the data
			error: unable to sign the tag
		 -->
		by default git push will not push git tags , so use 
		git push --tags

		now if select tag in github.com then you will see code base at the time of creating a tab

		<!-- creating new branch , rename branch , checkout new branch,   -->
		1. creating new branch 
		git branch feature1

		2. checkout branch - all commits are pushed to this repository 
		git checkout feature1 

		3. rename branch - m means move branch to new name 
		git branch -m feature1 bug1234

		4. delete branch 
		git branch -d bug1234
			a. git prevents me from deleting branch as it is not merged with master
		5. delete Branch by force even if it is not merged with master 
		git branch -D bug1234

		6. Creating a branch and checkout the branch instantly 
		git checkout -b feature2
